Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a nanoscale doubly clamped beam that is under high tension, immersed in a viscous fluid, and driven externally by a spatially varying drive force. We develop a theoretical description that is valid for all possible values of tension, includes the motion of the higher modes of the beam, and accounts for a harmonic force that is applied over a limited spatial region of the beam near its ends. We compare our theoretical predictions with experimental measurements for a nanoscale beam that is driven electrothermally and immersed in air and water. The theoretical predictions show good agreement with experiments, and the validity of a simplified string approximation is demonstrated.
