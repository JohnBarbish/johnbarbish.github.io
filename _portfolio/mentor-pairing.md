# Mentoring Matching
This project is contained in the git repository [mentoring-matching](https://github.com/JohnBarbish/mentoring-matching). This repository contains real example data from prospective mentors and mentees of a peer mentoring program of graduate mechanical engineering students. The code demonstrates how constraints and preferences in pairing mentors and mentees can be translated into a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem. Please see the [repository](https://github.com/JohnBarbish/mentoring-matching) for further details and to access the code and data.
