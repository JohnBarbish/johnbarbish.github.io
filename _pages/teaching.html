Below are some teaching aids that I have developed.

<h3>Crystallography Visualizations</h3>
<p>Using a new notebook software known as Marimo<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, I have developed some interactive visualization tools.</p>

The first visualization tool explores points and directions in crystallography. Please click to <a href="./crystalvis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open the crystallography visualization gui in a new tab</a>. In the new tab, you will be able to interactively modify the plots to explore and visualize point coordinates and direction vectors in a cubic unit cell. The visualization is also embedded below for faster use.

<h3>Materials and Advanced Mechanics Tutorials</h3>
I've developed a series of instructional videos demonstrating how to use perform common experiments and preparation for materials testing and characterization. I've compiled all of these tutorials into a playlist:

<h2>Pedagogy</h2>
After taking the Preparing the Future Professoriate certificate at VT, I've thought more about my teaching practices, and look forward to continuing to improve my pedagogy. Here is my current <a href="../files/barbish_teaching_philosophy.pdf">teaching philosophy.</a>
