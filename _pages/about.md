I'm John Barbish, a graduate student in mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech. I'm interested in improving our understanding of complex systems at the intersection of statistical mechanics, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear dynamics.

If you're interested in a random assortment of thoughts about graduate education, I've collected some of my thoughts on a [blog](https://blogs.tlos.vt.edu/grad5104johnb/) I wrote for a course on preparing the future professoriate.
