I'm Johnathon Barbish, a new visiting assistant professor in the Department of Engineering at James Madison University. I often go by my nickname John. I'm currently learning new teaching methods and pedagogy while at James Madison University. I am interested in many aspects of engineering, physics, and mathematics, with a special enjoyment from constructing and developing mathematical models of real systems. This has developed into my research into understanding complex systems. These complex systems include physics such as solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear dynamics. I use tools from statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory to investigate these systems.

I am interested in developing new collaborations on research and/or teaching pedagogy. If you are interested, please feel free to email me!
