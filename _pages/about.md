<!-- ## Johnathon (John) Barbish, Ph.D. -->
- **Instructor in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, current**
- **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech, 2018-2023**

I'm Johnathon Barbish, a recent Ph.D. graduate in mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech. I often go by my nickname John. I'm currently looking for new research opportunities while I am teaching as an instructor at Virginia Tech. My broad research interest include improving our understanding of complex systems including fluid mechanics and nonlinear dynamics by using tools from statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory.
